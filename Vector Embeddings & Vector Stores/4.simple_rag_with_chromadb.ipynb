       "AIMessage(content='**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an advanced method in artificial intelligence and natural language processing that combines two main components: information retrieval and text generation. Its goal is to improve the accuracy and factuality of AI-generated responses by allowing the model to access and use external data sources during generation.\\n\\n### Key Concepts:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**\\n   - When answering a user query, RAG first retrieves relevant documents or passages from a large external database (such as Wikipedia, company knowledge bases, or other text collections).\\n   - This retrieval step is usually done using a separate **retriever** model, which finds the most relevant context pieces based on the query.\\n\\n2. **Generation**\\n   - Next, a **generator** model (often a language model like GPT or BART) takes the retrieved information and generates a coherent and contextually appropriate answer.\\n   - The generator can cite, summarize, or synthesize information from the retrieved documents, making its response more accurate and up-to-date.\\n\\n### Why Use RAG?\\n\\n- **Up-to-date Knowledge:** The model isn\\'t limited to information seen during its training. By retrieving documents at runtime, it can provide more current or specific answers.\\n- **Improved Factuality:** Responses are grounded in actual documents, reducing the risk of hallucination (making up facts).\\n- **Scalability:** It can access vast amounts of information without needing to memorize it all in neural network weights.\\n\\n### How RAG Works (Overview):\\n\\n1. **Input:** User provides a query (e.g., \"What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?\").\\n2. **Retrieval:** The retriever finds several relevant documents from a data corpus.\\n3. **Augmentation:** The generator processes both the query and retrieved texts.\\n4. **Generation:** The generator outputs an answer that may reference or quote the retrieved documents.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nSuppose you ask, \"Who wrote \\'Pride and Prejudice\\'?\"  \\n- **Retriever:** Finds Wikipedia articles mentioning \\'Pride and Prejudice\\' and Jane Austen.\\n- **Generator:** Reads these passages and answers, \"Jane Austen wrote \\'Pride and Prejudice.\\'\"\\n\\n### Summary Table\\n\\n| Component    | Purpose                                                                 |\\n|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Retriever    | Finds relevant information from external database or documents          |\\n| Generator    | Produces human-like answers, referencing the retrieved information      |\\n\\n### Use Cases\\n\\n- Customer support chatbots\\n- Medical question answering\\n- Educational tools\\n- Search engines with natural language interfaces\\n\\n---\\n\\n**In summary:**  \\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by letting them fetch and use external information dynamically, resulting in more accurate and informed AI responses.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 545, 'prompt_tokens': 22, 'total_tokens': 567, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_1a2c4a5ede', 'id': 'chatcmpl-CqrRyDsrVhVa4U4BwgHBV8KECl4iQ', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019b5864-b3f5-7581-944f-8c253985c155-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 22, 'output_tokens': 545, 'total_tokens': 567, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})"
